# Mainnet FAQs

### Error when using Transfer function? <a href="#error-when-using-transfer-function" id="error-when-using-transfer-function"></a>

1. Confirm you have sufficient Ruby BNB balance
2. Make sure the transfer amount is less than or equal to the amount of Ruby BNB in your account, NOT the BNB balance in your MetaMask wallet
3. The recipient address must be a Ruby Public Address, you can NOT transfer tokens to a MetaMask wallet
   * Note: You cannot transfer tokens to your own Ruby Public Address, doing so will cause an error
   * See photo below for details&#x20;

* Since you cannot transfer Ruby BNB to your own public address, the best thing to do is set up another Ruby Account to test the application

* You can use the same MetaMask wallet to login to both of these accounts
