# Positioning Statement

In the Web3 Technical Stack Overview below, Ruby lies in the Privacy Layer of the Middleware Stack, between Query Layer and Data Storage Layer. Ruby proposes a private data management framework for Web 3.0 that implements a privacy layer interacting with the multi-chain ecosystem. Users could use any Web3.0 client, like Metamask, to interact with Ruby protocol. All users' data are safely encrypted and stored on the Data storage layer like IPFS.
