# Privacy Token Minting

### Mint Privacy Tokens (e.g. ETH -> pETH)

* Select the token you wish to transfer privately.
* Input your private key to log into your Ruby account.
* Enter the amount to mint. Please note that the unit ratio for each token is different. (e.g., 1 ETH = 100 Units of pETH)

Click "Confirm Mint" to get your privacy tokens. Your Ruby account will display your minted privacy token's in units, and your MetaMask account will change accordingly.

Privacy tokens, which are anonymized versions of their native tokens, are presented as "p" + the name of the native token. So, for example, privatized $ETH will be listed as pETH on the Ruby PoC, $USDT will be listed as pUSDT, and so on.
