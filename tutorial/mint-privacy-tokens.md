# Mint Privacy Tokens

### Mint Privacy Tokens (e.g. BNB -> rBNB)

* From the home screen, select the token you wish to transfer privately
* Input your private key and log into your Raze account.
* Enter the amount of tokens you wish to mint. The unit of measurement is Unit and the unit ratio for each token is different. (e.g. 1 BNB = 100 Units of rBNB)
* Click "Confirm Mint" to create your privacy tokens (BNB -> rBNB)
* After you complete the above steps, your Raze account will display your minted privacy token's in units, and your native token amount in your MetaMask account will correspondingly decrease.
* Privacy tokens, which are anonymized versions of their native tokens, are usually presented as **“r” + the name of the native token**. For example, privatized $ETH will be listed as rETH on Raze network, $USDT will be listed as rUSDT, and $RAZE will be listed as rRAZE.
