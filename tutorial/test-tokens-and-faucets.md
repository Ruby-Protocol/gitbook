# Test Tokens & Faucets

Ruby Connect is now running on **Optimism Goerli**, therefore the very step to experiencing our PoC is to acquire the test tokens.

## Goerli Faucet

If you do not have any GoerliETH yet, we recommend getting it from Alchemy's faucet [<mark style="color:red;">here</mark>](https://goerlifaucet.com/?a=818c11a8da).

## Bridging to Optimism Goerli

To get the test token for Ruby Connect, it is recommended that you should bridge tokens from Goerli to Optimism Goerli via [https://app.optimism.io/bridge](https://app.optimism.io/bridge).&#x20;

1.  Switch network in metamask.

2.  Make sure the source network is switched to Goerli.

3. Then you can proceed to deposit the amount you like and experience Ruby PoC.

_Bridging takes time, please wait patiently._
