# FAQs

### Error when using Transfer function? <a href="#error-when-using-transfer-function" id="error-when-using-transfer-function"></a>

1. Please confirm you have sufficient Ruby ETH balance.
2. Make sure the transfer amount is less than or equal to the amount of Ruby ETH in your account, NOT the ETH balance in your MetaMask wallet.
3. The recipient address must be a Ruby Public Address, you can NOT transfer tokens to a MetaMask wallet.
   * Note: You cannot transfer tokens to your own Ruby Public Address, doing so will cause an error
   * See photo below for details

### **Why can't I log in?** <a href="#why-can-i-not-login-to-the-mainnet" id="why-can-i-not-login-to-the-mainnet"></a>

1. Please make sure you are inputting the correct Ruby Private Key when logging in.
2. Also make sure your MetaMask wallet is set to the Optimism-Goerli Network.

### How do I use the Transfer function if I do not know another Ruby Public Address? <a href="#how-do-i-use-the-transfer-function-if-i-do-not-know-another-ruby-public-address" id="how-do-i-use-the-transfer-function-if-i-do-not-know-another-ruby-public-address"></a>

* Since you cannot transfer Ruby BNB/ETH to your own public address, the next reasonable thing to do is set up another Ruby Account to test the application.
* The additional account will provide you with a second Ruby Public Address that you can transfer the Ruby ETH to.
* You can use the same MetaMask wallet to login to both of these accounts.
