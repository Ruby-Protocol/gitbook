# Ruby Protocol PoC

Ruby Protocol is a private data management framework for Web 3.0 that proposes and implements a privacy layer interacting with the multi-chain ecosystem. It is a fine-grained private data access-control gateway across different entities and organizations in the decentralized and traditional financial world.

However, Ruby’s Proof of Concept starts from the most fundamental need of crypto space, which is to enforce the private transfer of funds and to enable cross-chain privacy-preserving payment while protecting your assets and behaviors from surveillance.&#x20;

Our Proof of Concept (PoC) team is focused on developing technology demonstrations to showcase how our solutions can be executed and utilized in real-world environments to help with the expanding data management needs.

With this version of PoC, users can use Ruby Protocol to anonymize any cryptocurrency across different blockchains. In addition, with experience in building products with zero-knowledge algorithms and zkSNARK techniques on Ethereum, our team is confident in building state-of-the-art privacy solutions and accommodating more needs.

As for Ruby Protocol‘s Proof of Concept, we try to demonstrate how we can enable transactions with built-in privacy. After several rounds of development optimizations to improve user experiences, we reduce the underlying logic to private minting at a ratio of 1:1 on a contract level.

Below are the technical features and components included in the Ruby Protocol‘s Proof of Concept:

* Malleable: We consider this PoC version to be very plastic in the sense that it is a foundation on which we can build our future private data management system and expand it further.
* Crypto-native: We start building this PoC from the most fundamental need of crypto space - value transfer.
* To mint: Users can convert any token into an anonymized version, which is the prerequisite of a private transaction.
* To redeem: In return, users can convert the anonymized token back into its native form.
* To transfer: When transferring tokens using Ruby’s PoC, this exchange will be executed anonymously, concealing the identity of both sender and receiver as well as the amount being executed.
